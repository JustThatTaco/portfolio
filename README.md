# This is my website

This is my personal website, made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript under the react framework. It is hosted at this link https://catoywen.github.io/portfolio/.

This is my first time coding a website. I didn't follow any tutorials and only
used documentation and ChatGPT as reference.
