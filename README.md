# This is my website

This is my personal website, made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript under the React framework. It is hosted at this [link](https://catoywen.github.io/portfolio/).

This is my first time coding a website. I didn't follow any tutorials and only
used documentation and ChatGPT as references. 

The drawings used in the website were drawn by hand using Procreate on an ipad.
The font used on the website is the font from the game "Omori" by Omocat.

The code used to display my resume uses the structure detailed by Sagar Shrestha's
Medium [article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/displaying-pdf-in-react-app-6e9d1fffa1a9) using a react [library](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf) developed by Wojtekmaj.
