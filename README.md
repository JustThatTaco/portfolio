# Cato Wen's Personal Website

This is my personal website, made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript under the React framework. It is hosted at this [link](https://catoywen.github.io/portfolio/).

The drawings used in the website were drawn by hand using Procreate on an ipad.
The font used on the website is the font from the game "Omori" by Omocat.

The code used to display my resume modifies the implementation detailed by Sagar Shrestha's Medium [article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/displaying-pdf-in-react-app-6e9d1fffa1a9) and uses the react [library](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf) developed by Wojtekmaj.
